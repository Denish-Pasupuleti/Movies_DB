      <h1>My Project</h1>
      <p>This is a simple website that shows the results of MySQL queries and explains what information it has gathered.</p>
      <h1>My Data</h1>
      <p>Although I could have used a massive database with thousands of movies, I chose to include only a select few.</p>
      <p>This is to show the reuslts of the queries in a much more managable way.</p>
      <p>Ofcourse, this application can be scaled up into a much larger operation provided the right database and tweaking of the frontend.</p>
      <p>Thank you for viewing my project!</p>
